           Travelling Through Time With Quantum Tunneling
        <hr>
    </h1>
    <h2>
            No sooner had the radical equations of quantum mechanics been discovered than physicists 
            <br>
            identified one of the strangest phenomena the theory allows.
    </h2>
    <p>
        Physicists quickly saw that particles ability to tunnel through barriers solved many mysteries. <br>
        It explained various chemical bonds and radioactive decays and how hydrogen nuclei in the sun are able 
        to overcome their mutual repulsion and fuse, producing sunlight. <br>
    </p>
    <p>
        “Quantum tunneling” shows how profoundly particles such as electrons differ from bigger things. 
        Throw a ball at the wall and it bounces backward; let it roll to the bottom of a valley and it stays there. 
        But a particle will occasionally hop through the wall. 
        It has a chance of “slipping through the mountain and escaping from the valley,”

        <u>
        Q:- How can quantum tunneling be used in Travelling?
        </u>
    </h3>
    <p>
        Some physicists have proposed a model of faster-than-light (FTL) travel, formulated in the context of Lorentzian manifolds,
         which are used in general relativity to construct space-time continuum models. 
        In normal , nothing can move faster than the speed of light. Einstein's theory of relativity forbids it. 
        There are two exceptions to this rule however. 
        The first is what's commonly called a worm hole, a bridge connecting two different parts of space. 
        A ship crossing this bridge would move at below light speed, but still arrive before a beam of light that would have
         had to go the long way around.

    <p>
        If the wave energy emitted by a spaceship in the form of beam interacts with vacuum electromagnetic zero-point field (ZPF),
        it perturbs ZPF and decreases zero-point radiation pressure, the zero-point radiation pressure in the rear vicinity of spaceship acting
        upon spaceship. For decreasing ZPF energy, we can utilize negative energy radiation. There are two main approaches to generate negative
        energy, which are the Casimir effect and the squeezed vacuum.

        CONCLUSION
    </h3>
    <p>
        In this paper, the author presents an advanced theory that the spaceship can be traveled at superluminal speed by applying the Puthoff’s 
        theory on ZPF field. From the theoretical analysis, it can be seen that the FTL travel can be achieved by the quantum tunneling effect 
        induced by the manipulation of the ZPF spectrum surrounding the spaceship.
